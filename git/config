# Pull configuration for managing dotfiles across multiple computers
# Using rebase instead of merge keeps a clean, linear history
# This is especially useful for personal repos like dotfiles where:
# - You're often the only contributor
# - You make quick updates from different machines
# - You want to avoid unnecessary merge commits cluttering the history
# With this setting, 'git pull' automatically rebases your local changes
# on top of the remote changes, keeping everything tidy
