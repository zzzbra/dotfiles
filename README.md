# dotfiles

Once the repository has been cloned to our home directory, simply change to the
dotfiles directory, make the makesymlinks.sh script executable, and run the
script, like so:

`cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
./makesymlinks.sh`

## TODO
[] add session exit script
[] follow .config/ directory convention
